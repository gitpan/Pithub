=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pithub;
    use Data::Dumper;

    $result = Pithub->new->repos->get( user => 'plu', repo => 'Pithub' );
    print Dumper $result->content;

    $result = Pithub->new( user => 'plu' )->repos->get( repo => 'Pithub' );

=head1 WARNING

L<Pithub> as well as the
L<Github v3 API|http://developer.github.com/v3/> are still under
development. So there might be things broken on both sides. Besides
that it's possible that the API will change. This applies to
L<Pithub> itself as well as the
L<Github v3 API|http://developer.github.com/v3/>.

=head1 MODULES

There are different ways of using Pithub library. You can either
use the main module C<< Pithub >> to get access to all other
modules like L<Pithub::Repos> for example, or you can use
L<Pithub::Repos> directly. In the synopsis above, all the calls
are equivalent. Here's an overview over all modules and how to
get access to them:

Besides that there are other modules involved. Every method call
which maps directly to a Github API call returns a
L<Pithub::Result> object. This contains everything interesting
about the response (L<Pithub::Response>) returned from the API
call as well as the request (L<Pithub::Request>). Even the
L<Pithub::Base> module might be interesting because this one
provides the L<Pithub::Base/request> method, which is used by
all other modules. In case Github adds a new API call which is
not supported yet by L<Pithub> the L<Pithub::Base/request>
method can be used directly.
